# Odin-Linked-Lists

## Project tasks.

### Build two classes or factories:
- [x] Add LinkedList class / factory, which will represent the full list.
- [x] Add Node class / factory, containing a value property and a link to the nextNode, set both as null by default.

### Build the following functions in the linked list class:
- [x] append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list.
- [x] prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list.
- [x] size() returns the total number of nodes in the list.
- [x] head() returns the first node in the list.
- [x] tail() returns the last node in the list.
- [x] at(index) returns the node at the given index.
- [x] pop() removes the last element from the list.
- [x] contains(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
- [x] find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
- [x] toString() represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null.

### Extra credit:
- [x] insertAt(value, index) that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
- [x] removeAt(index) that removes the node at the given index.
